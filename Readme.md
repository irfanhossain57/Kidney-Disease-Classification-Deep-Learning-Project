Project Overview
Kidney disease diagnosis from CT scan images is a critical clinical challenge. Manual inspection is slow and subject to error. This project builds a fully automated, production-ready classification pipeline that:

Classifies kidney CT scans as either Normal or Tumor using Transfer Learning
Tracks every experiment (parameters, metrics, artifacts) with MLflow across 3 pipeline stages
Ensures reproducibility with DVC-managed data and pipeline versioning
Builds clinical trust by visualizing model decisions using Grad-CAM heatmaps
Surfaces everything in a modern Streamlit UI for real-time interaction

ML Pipeline Architecture
The DVC pipeline consists of 6 reproducible stages, each with explicit dependencies and outputs tracked by DVC:

Data Ingestion
      │
      ▼
Data Validation ──► validation_report.json
      │
      ▼
Data Transformation ──► train / val / test splits
      │
      ▼
Training ──────────► best_model.pth ──► MLflow logs: params + loss curves 
      │                                
      ▼                               
Evaluation ────────► evaluation_report.json ──► MLflow logs: accuracy, F1, AUC
      │
      ▼
XAI (Grad-CAM) ────► gradcam_outputs/ ──► MLflow logs: heatmap artifacts
Run the complete pipeline end-to-end with a single command:

dvc repro
DVC only re-runs stages whose dependencies have changed, making iteration fast and auditable.

Model & Hyperparameters
All hyperparameters live in params.yaml — the single source of truth consumed by DVC and MLflow:

Parameter	Value	Description
MODEL_NAME	efficientnet_b0	Backbone model (resnet50, densenet121 also supported)
PRETRAINED	True	Use ImageNet pre-trained weights
IMAGE_SIZE	[224, 224]	Input resolution for all images
BATCH_SIZE	16	Training & evaluation batch size
EPOCHS	10	Maximum training epochs
OPTIMIZER	adam	Optimizer algorithm
LEARNING_RATE	0.0001	Initial learning rate
WEIGHT_DECAY	0.00001	L2 regularization factor
LOSS_FUNCTION	bcewithlogits	Binary Cross-Entropy with Logits (binary classification)
NUM_CLASSES	1	Single sigmoid output for binary classification
AUGMENTATION	True	Apply data augmentation during transformation
TRAIN_SPLIT	0.70	70% of data for training
VAL_SPLIT	0.15	15% of data for validation
TEST_SPLIT	0.15	15% of data for testing
SEED	42	Random seed for reproducibility
Early Stopping is enabled (patience=5) monitoring val_accuracy. The best checkpoint is automatically saved.

Evaluation Metrics
The evaluation stage computes and logs the following metrics to both a JSON report and MLflow:

Metric	Description
Accuracy	Overall correct predictions
Precision	Of predicted tumors, how many were actually tumors
Recall (Sensitivity)	Of actual tumors, how many were correctly detected
Specificity	Of actual normal cases, how many were correctly identified
F1 Score	Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall
ROC-AUC	Area under the ROC curve
Confusion Matrix	TP, TN, FP, FN breakdown (saved separately)
Metrics are saved to artifacts/evaluation/evaluation_report.json and displayed live in the Streamlit sidebar.

MLflow Experiment Tracking
MLflow tracks every run under the experiment name Kidney_Disease_Classification across 3 pipeline stages:

Stage	What Is Logged
Training	Hyperparameters (model, optimizer, LR, epochs, batch size), train/validation loss per epoch
Evaluation	Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Specificity, F1, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix artifact
XAI	Generated Grad-CAM heatmap images as artifacts
Launch the MLflow tracking UI:

mlflow ui
Then navigate to http://localhost:5000 to compare runs, inspect metrics, and download artifacts.

Explainable AI (Grad-CAM)
Medical AI demands transparency. This project integrates Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to answer "Why did the model predict this?"

How it works: Grad-CAM computes gradients of the final convolutional layer's activations with respect to the predicted class, producing a heatmap over the original image.
Target Layer: model.features[-1] (last convolutional block of EfficientNet-B0)
Pipeline Stage: Stage 6 generates heatmaps for 20 test samples, logs them to MLflow
Live in App: The Streamlit UI generates Grad-CAM overlays in real-time for any uploaded CT scan
Red/warm regions in the heatmap indicate areas the model focused on most heavily when making its prediction.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Git
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Khalidi-Siam/Kidney-Disease-Classification-with-MLflow-and-DVC.git
cd Kidney-Disease-Classification-with-MLflow-and-DVC
2. Create & Activate a Virtual Environment
python -m venv env

# Windows
env\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source env/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
This also installs the kidney_disease_classification package in editable mode via -e .

4. Reproduce the Full ML Pipeline
DVC will automatically download the dataset, run all 6 stages, and generate all artifacts:

dvc repro
Only stages with changed dependencies are re-executed on subsequent runs.

Running the Application
Launch the Streamlit App
streamlit run app.py
The app provides:

Upload any kidney CT scan (.jpg, .jpeg, .png)
Prediction with confidence score (Normal / Tumor)
Grad-CAM heatmap overlay showing model attention areas
Model information sidebar — training parameters + evaluation metrics
View MLflow Experiments
mlflow ui
Access at http://localhost:5000

Dataset
The dataset used is the CT Kidney Dataset (binary subset: Normal vs. Tumor).

Source: Hosted on Google Drive, auto-downloaded during the Data Ingestion stage
Download URL: Configured in config/config.yaml (source_URL)
Format: Organized as kidney-ct-scan-image/Normal/ and kidney-ct-scan-image/Tumor/ directories
Splits: Automatically split 70/15/15 (train/val/test) during the Data Transformation stage
Limitations
Limitation	Details
Small Dataset	The dataset contains a limited number of CT scan samples. A larger, more diverse dataset would significantly improve model generalization to unseen real-world cases.
Binary Classification Only	The current model classifies only Normal vs. Tumor. The original CT Kidney dataset includes Cyst and Stone categories, which are not modeled here.
Single Modality	The model is trained solely on CT scan images. Clinical diagnosis typically incorporates additional data (patient history, blood markers, etc.) not considered here.
Not Clinically Validated	This project is built for educational and demonstration purposes. It has not been validated against clinical standards and should not be used for actual medical diagnosis.
Built to demonstrate robust MLOps practices, Interpretable Deep Learning, and production-grade medical imaging pipelines.
